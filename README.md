# 100DaysA

## What is this about?

With this cross-platform app, you can add and manage lists of things you want to do daily, for a 100 days.
This project was started after watching the following video from Yes Theory https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKuhvTGiXz4 about a 100 Day challenge.

## What can you do with it?

 - Add lists
 - Check and view your progress daily
 - Set the goal to a custom amount of days
 
## Future update features

 - Daily notifications to help you remember at your specified times
 - Statistics on how you manage to complete your goal
 - and more.
 
## Can I help?

Sure. I don't know much about React Native yet, so cleaning up my code or adding new features is welcome.
